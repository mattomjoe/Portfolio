    <h2>About Me</h2>

    </br>

    <img src="assets/images/matt-yellowstone.jpg" id="headshot">

    <p>Greetings! I am an aspiring full stack web developer with an eclectic career to this point, starting with a degree in Graphic Design I earned from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I have worked in roles ranging from production artist, to project lead, to analyst, to project coordinator. I have also worked for companies as big as Target Corporate, to small consulting companies with 20 or less employees. I am ready to take on a new direction and challenge in my career!</p>
    </br>
    <p>I was born in Green Bay, WI, but have lived most of my life in Minnesota. I also root for all the local Minnesota teams, a curse I have not been able to overcome (with the exception of a handful of Twins and Lynx championships!).</p>
    </br>
    <p>I enjoy cooking, graphic arts, exercise, road trips with my wife and kids.</p>
    </br>
    <p>My dream job is more about its essence than its destination. I would like to have something I can point to at the end of the day and say, "here is what I contributed to this project". Like architecture, I see web development work as something I can work on building every day and see the progress toward the final vision to be achieved. What it really boils down to is, I want to take the various skills I have, develop them, and use them to build something.</p>
